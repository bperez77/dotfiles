[user]

    # Set the default name and email address used in commits.
    name = Brandon Perez
    email = bmperez@alumni.cmu.edu

[core]

    # Use Vim as the default editor, which is utilized for things such as writing commit messages.
    editor = vim

    # Allow for parallel index preloading to speed up operations like Diff. Good for filesystems with poor caching.
    preloadIndex = true

    # Convert newline characters to this machine's locale's line endings, but keep the original when pushing changes to
    # the remote repository. This aids with smooth interoperability between Linux and Windows.
    autocrlf = input

    # Set common whitespace problems to be noticed for commands such as git diff and git apply. Detect extraneous
    # whitespace at the end of a line, extra lines at the end of a file, space before tab characters, and when tab
    # characters are used for indentation as errors. Also, set the default tab width to 4.
    whitespace = blank-at-eol,blank-at-eof,space-before-tab,tab-in-indent,tabwidth=4

[color]

    # Always use colors for commands (e.g. Grep, Diff, etc.), even if the output is not to a terminal. This means colors
    # codes will be outputted when piped to another command, but also when writing to a file.
    ui = always

    # Override the default color settings for Diff. Don't display color codes if the output is not a terminal. This is
    # important for creating patch files with Diff, as color codes will cause issues if they are put in the patch file.

# Command Settings

[blame]

    # Use relative date format (e.g. 2 days ago) by default when using Blame.

[commit]

    # changes that are not going to be committed (i.e. unstaged changes).
    verbose = 2

[diff]

    # Use the histogram algorithm instead of the default Myers/greedy algorithm for generating diffs. This is an
    # improved and faster version of the patience algorithm, which improves generated diffs by matching unique lines.
    algorithm = histogram

    # Enables an (experimental) heuristic that shifts the diff hunk boundaries in a way that is more intuitive. The
    # heuristic attempts to respect the indentation levels of the files, so diff hunks are proper blocks of code.

    # example, a plain diff compares the index (i) and work (w) tree.
