Host *
    # This option sends a request to the server after the given time if no data has been received from it (the session
    # is idle). This prevents servers from thinking the client is not alive and killing the connection.
    ServerAliveInterval 60


# Open SSH no longer allows RSA with SHA-1 by default as it is very weak algorithm for a connection. However, Azure
# servers only support this mode, so RSA with SHA-1 (ssh-rsa) must be allowed explicitly for these hosts. This is also
# restricted solely to Git commands as that it the only command needed.
